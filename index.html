Line of Sight, a volumetric presentation of light becoming architectural matter. Dynamic graphic forms are articulated into the physical volume by the material of the thread and the semi- material of the light, creating a rich sparse canvas.<br/><br/><em>Itself, it hangs abstract and undefined, a set of thin positive elements entangling the dark negative space between. A 2D canvas is reduced from a surface piece into a line segment, but then constructed in another dimension, into a volume. Space becomes canvas. Light creates contrast and order on the lines to articulate digital matter. These digital forms inhabit the interconnected boundaries of space, segmenting visual mass into sprites, actors and scene. The spectator is offered a tightly choreographed audiovisual experience that explores storytelling possibilities of the space/display hybrid.</em><br/><br/>Kimchi and Chips in collaboration with Nanika continue to define new ways of drawing within their body of research, which exploits digital light as a semi-material to articulate digital visual mass into physical space, creating a liquid suspension of the imaginary within the physical realm. For Resonate 2014, a new installation at the ground floor of Kinoteka venue takes the form of \"live install\". The light on the thread is enacted by digital video projectors. Each video projector pixel passes through the space as a ray from the projector to the opposite wall, each pixel is carried along a unique path.

Lemercier was introduced to creating art on a computer at age five by attending classes on pattern design for fabrics taught by his mother. The threads of his early education grounded his interest in physical structures: geometry, patterns, and minimalist forms. As Lemercier’s work evolved, he began to play with these concrete structures through the physics and philosophy of how light can be used to manipulate perceived reality.<br/><br/>Since 2006 Lemercier has worked with projected light, and he co founded visual label AntiVJ in 2008, with artists Yannick Jacquet, Romain Tardy and Olivier Ratsi. He worked on stage design for festivals such as Mutek (Montreal, Mexico) and worked alongside artists such as Flying Lotus (special show at the Roundhouse London), and with Portishead’s Adrian Utley (as part of the cultural Olympiads, London 2012), and architectural projections all around the world.<br/><br/>In 2010, Lemercier turned his focus on installations and gallery work, and exhibited at China Museum of Digital Art, (Beijing), Art Basel Miami and Sundance film festival 2013. In 2013, Lemercier founded a creative studio in NYC, focused on research and development of artworks and experiments that use projected light in space.

Having as a test bed a very unique context at the borders of the Sahara Desert, in the Southern Tunisia, the project aimed to stimulate a new bio-urban territory by reconsidering the relationship between man, city, and nature through ecological solutions in the way we inhabit such extreme and arid environments. Algorithmic design methods and urban dynamic simulations such as the Diffusion Limited Aggregation simulation script, have been used as design tools to explore how a natural accreted processes can be employed as a design method to generate dialogues across scales(from the molecular to the territorial) unveiling the links of a fragile ecosystem’s equilibrium. The research design team is consisted by the architects Artemis Karaiskou, Antonios Lalos and Anna Sideri, which was formed during their M.Arch Urban Design Graduate studies in the Bartlett [B-Pro] School of Architecture, under the supervision of Marco Polleto and Claudia Pasquero [ecoLogic Studio].<br/><br/>Artemis Karaiskou graduated with distinction from National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) and subsequently, completed with merit a masters in Urban Design at Bartlett School of Architecture, University College London (UCL). Her works focused on experimentation of space - particularly within extreme. Her undergraduate diploma thesis on Disaster Prevention and Education Centre in Athens was selected amongst 500 proposals to be exhibited in the inaugural GREAT (Greek Architectural Talents) exhibition which seeks to promote Greek architectural creation. In addition, her published works include the regeneration of voids in Athens city centre, which was recognized by an esteemed newspaper for its innovative methodology. Upon graduation, she endeavours to continue her design trajectory and transcends boundaries in the designing of eco-social environments.<br/><br/>Antonios Lalos is a graduate Architect. He studied architecture in Oxford Brookes University and gained his Postgraduate Diploma in Architectural design with Distinction, at the University of Lincoln. In 2012, the Architects Journal selected Antonios as the standout student for University of Lincoln and was later nominated for the Presidents Silver Medal award of RIBA for his thesis project ‘FU city’. At this moment he has completed B-Pro Masters degree in Urban Design at the Bartlett School of Architecture, University College of London with a Merit (UCL), under the supervision of Marco Polleto and Claudia Pasquero [ecoLogic Studio].<br/><br/>Αnna Sideri is an architect-engineer and graduated from the National Technical University of Athens, School of Architecture in November 2011. During her undergraduate studies she took part in international architectural competitions and workshops. The \"Nested Living Rooms\" project, which took part in an international competition in Moscow, was ranked 4th at the DOMES Awards 2013, in the category ‘Best Project of the years 2010-2012’, with Kenneth Frampton being one among the jury. After finishing her undergraduate studies, she worked as an Assistant Architect in the architectural office C+Ph Scroumbelos where she participated in a research study for an urban proposal intervention for the municipality of Athens, Greece.

As the studio adjusts to a wide range of projects, we are focusing less on medium and more on ideas.<br/><br/>As a studio, SOFTlab embraces projects that are strange, difficult, blurry and straddle multiple mediums. The constraints of each project are treated as opportunities and tested through a collaborative studio environment with the hopes of solving typical problems in new ways, with new tools. Through the studio’s unique blend of backgrounds as designers, artists, architects and educators, we are able to approach every project from a fresh perspective to create rich spatial, graphic, interactive and visual experiences. By mixing research, creativity and technology with a strong desire to make work fun, SOFTlab attempts to create new and unique experiences.<br/><br/>In 2012 SOFTlab was awarded the Architectural League Prize for Young Architects &amp; Designers, and previously in 2010 the studio was selected for the New Practices New York award by the AIA Chapter of New York along with 7 other young studios.

Through moving image works they explore the material nature of our world, how we experience it and how we try to make an understanding of it, questioning our place in the physical universe. Their unique approach has won them many awards and prestigious fellowships, most recently the ‘Samsung Art + Prize UK’ 2012 for new media, the ‘Golden Gate Award for New Visions’ at San Francisco International Film Festival USA 2012 and the ‘Art and Science Award’ at Ann Arbor Film Festival USA 2012.<br/><br/>Semiconductor make distinctive and innovative works which push the boundaries of moving image as a visual language. Always looking to extend mans experience of the natural physical world, their works delve into unseen worlds and create visual interpretations of these through self developed technical processes and unique aesthetics. Their works transcend the tools that have been used to make them, instead creating new forms of expression that defy genre and provide new experiences for audiences.<br/><br/>In recent years works have developed from fellowship opportunities which have taken them into unique science laboratories to observe how man creates an understanding of the material world around us, these include; NASA Space Sciences Laboratory UC Berkeley California 2005, Mineral Sciences Laboratory, Smithsonian Museum of Natural History 2010 and the Charles Darwin Research Station, Galapagos 2010.<br/><br/>Works include; Black Rain, a moving image installation which uses satellite image data to observe the space between the Sun and the Earth, Indefatigable, a moving image work observing scientists at work on the Galapagos Islands and Magnetic Movie, a live action and CGI moving image work exploring the material nature of interplanetary magnetic fields at a NASA space sciences laboratory.<br/><br/>HD limited editions of Magnetic Movie and Brilliant Noise are part of the permanent collections of Hirshhorn Museum Washington DC, USA and the Pompidou Centre, Paris, France.

In a troubled Serbia of the 90’s, Marko and his buddies built one of the most vibrant club scenes in Eastern Europe, the one that inspired writers of Mixmag, The Face, DJ and NME to write accolades many moons ago. They resisted dark forces of political madness through electronic music and a celebration of life.<br/><br/>DJing and music were always part of Marko Nastic’s background: even in his pre-teen years he was fascinated with synthesizers, drum machines and other sound making gadgets. When techno started filtering through to Serbia in the early 90’s, Marko eagerly entered the scene. Soon word on a teenage techno prodigy started spreading around town and this energy channeled into a young &amp; aspiring DJ team called Teenage Techno Punks – all of whom were under 18. Nastic was the leader of the pack, soon to become the hottest talent of South Eastern Europe’s electronic scene. The queues to enter clubs in the region on the nights they performed were longer than ever. The word soon started to spread beyond the boundaries of Serbia.<br/><br/>Just as techno music was becoming popular in Serbia, the Balkan conflict escalated. Marko was too young to fully realize the gravity of the situation, but it did have an impact on his life. “Things were tense, but a lot of it luckily went over my head,” he admits. “It also meant that buying records then was very difficult and the choice was poor”. These circumstances shaped and strengthened Marko just like other kids there. The free parties they threw during those times are still an urban legend in Belgrade.<br/><br/>After the war, the club scenes in neighboring countries became aware of Nastic’s unparalleled DJing skills and his distinctive three-deck style. Marko has since matured into a DJ who cannot be labeled as purely techno, house or minimal; he’s all of that, and more.<br/><br/>Marko was a member of the original Recycled Loops crew. After that label stopped, Marko joined Valentino Kanzyani’s ‘Jesus Loved You’ and started three labels himself, Recon Warriors, which put Marko on the charts, followed by Recon Light and Traffica. Also Marko has loads of projects running at the moment. For example Space Explorers with Marko Milosaljevic, Tango and Cash with Kobaya and don’t forget the projects with Dejan Milicevic. Marko did his first non-European tour in 2002, which started in Brazil. Now he regularly plays gigs all over the world.<br/><br/>(<a href=\"http://www.reconwarriors.com/Artists/204/Marko+Nastic.shtml/nav_start=0#biography\" target=\"_blank\">source</a>)<br/><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/djmarkonastic\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/djmarkonastic</a>", gallery: [{img: "http://resonate.io/2014/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/892400_10151564825195761_1490351748_o.jpg"}], categories: [{ cid: "performance", id: 4 }] } );items.push( { id: 233, slug: "manuel-jimenez-garcia-bartlett", title: "Manuel Jimenez Garcia (Bartlett)", content: "Manuel Jiménez García is currently Course Master of Research Cluster 4 at the MArch Graduate Architectural Design (GAD) and Unit Master of MArch Unit 19, both at The Bartlett School of Architecture (UCL)(London); he is also curator of the Bartlett Computational Plexus and Programme Director at the Architectural Association\'s Visiting School in Madrid (AAVSM).

Already his debut “My Old School“ (which is meant literally by the way) on Permanent Vacation in 2009 and shortly after that the single “ Sunshine”, which he put out on his own Hivern Disc imprint, made him one of the most promising musicians of the Spanish electronic scene. And those two releases also already set the mark for John Talabot’s unparalleled music: raw, loopy, heavy on the kick drum, sample based, moderate on the tempo, distorted on the drums and light years away from the clean and ever revolving house sound of today. This unique style which also blends influences from afro beat, Detroit techno, Chicago house and cosmic disco, but also northern soul or the energy of Flamenco, immediately turned some heads around. James Murphy, Âme and Aeroplane started including Talabot music in their sets like it was the most natural thing. However – and this is quite rare – he not only gained legions of fans in the house and disco community, but also amongst the leftfield pop and indie rock followers. NME and Resident Advisor both had “Breakthrough“ features on John Talabot and he can be proud of a “Best New Music“ dubbing on Pitchfork. (Being rather elusive on showing his face in magazines or the web it also came to some funny rumors that John Talabot was the alter ego of a well-known techno producer from Detroit).<br/><br/>At the same time he drew the attention of like-minded artists like James Holden and Luke Abott from Border Community, Blondes or Delorean, which lead to a bunch of fertile collaborations: Luke Abbot and Blondes remixed Talabot’s “Sunshine“ single , John Talabot remixed a track by Delorean and vice versa Delorean’s Ekhi contributed vocals to the track “Journeys “ on John’s album). Another example is the Young Turks Label (home of Jamie XX, Holy Fuck, El Guincho or SBTRKT ) on which he released the “Families“ EP in 2010. It was praised beyond limits. Pitchfork for instance hailed: “… where pop and house influences sweetly buffer up against one another to provide an unyielding sense of elation“ and even brought Talabot a comparison with artists like Four Tet or Caribou.<br/><br/>While staying true to his sound, John Talabot has nevertheless shown a constant evolution as a producer since his first release. He has traced a solid musical path that has turned him into one of the big references of European House and has made him also a highly in demand Remixer (for the likes of The XX, Francesco Tristano’s “Aufgang” project, Shit Robot on DFA, Thaiti 80, Joakim or Teengirl Fantasy to name just a few ).<br/><br/>A progression that now crystallizes in “ƒin”, his first full-length album for Permanent Vacation. A record, in which the Barcelona mastermind sets aside the danceable immediacy to expand his stylistic palette more than ever. For that purpose, Talabot melts all the elements that have constructed his distinctive sound until now and makes them emerge from a new perspective, in which the construction of complex song structures, intricate rhythms and superpositions of ever-evolving melodies and atmospheres pick up the baton of the “a kick-drum and a sampler” philosophy of his initial productions. The result brings us 11 tracks (we should call them songs really!) dominated by dark ambiances, gaseous textures and bittersweet moods that, above all, reveal a kind of vivacity that’s really hard to find in contemporary electronics. “Fin” is far from being a track collection. From the majestic opener “Depak Ine“ to it’s solemn ending with “So Will Be Now“ , one of the two tracks that features Talabot’s soul and label mate Pional, each song traces an overall dialogue with the rest, culminating a highly emotional journey through Talabot’s always compelling and unique musical vision.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.windishagency.com/artists/john_talabot\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.windishagency.com/artists/john_talabot</a><br/><a href=\"http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/johntalabot\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/johntalabot</a><br/><br/><img src=\"http://resonate.io/2014/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/unnamed.png\" width=\"301\" height=\"320\" class=\"alignnone\" />", gallery: [{img: "http://resonate.io/2014/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/john-talabot-miami-live-young-turks.jpg"},{img: "http://resonate.io/2014/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/john_talabot_press_shot1.jpg"}], categories: [{ cid: "performance", id: 4 }] } );items.push( { id: 943, slug: "onedotzero_rewind", title: "onedotzero_rewind", content: "onedotzero_rewind takes a look back at early work from the first five years of onedotzero.
